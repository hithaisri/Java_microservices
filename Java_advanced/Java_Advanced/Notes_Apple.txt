Final class is immutable 
String is built in immutable

Greedy

step 1: copy ele of a[4] to new array
step 2: copy ele of a[3] to new array
step 3: check for duplicates in the using a set and remove


step 1:create a new set 
step 2:add elements of a[3] and a[4] to the set 
step 3: iterate through the set and add the elements to a new array which is of size of the set.

 

DP
step 1: using loop add the characters to a new string in the reverse order 
step 2: compare using equals if both the strings match or not



step1: create a string builder and append the string to it.
step2: using the in built reverse func on the string builder
step3: compare the two strings if equal 




BT
reversing a square matrix

step1: take the start and end of the row i .e i=0 and j=n-1
step2: take a loop for the columns of the matrix 
step3: until i<j is true swap the elements of the row and proceed with next row 


Binary addition

i=0,j=0
if(i==j && i==0)
if(carry=0) res+=0
else res=1
if(i==j && i==1)
if(carry=0) res+=0 carry=1
else 

return 10
if(i!=j)
return 1
